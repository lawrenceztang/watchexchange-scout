"[WTS] Tank de Slim Jim**Snap into style with the elegant Tank de Slim Jim**

Producer: Slim Jim

Year: 90’s

Dimensions: 27mm x 35mm

Case: Polished Steel

Movement: Citizen Miyota cal. 2034 Japanese Quartz 

Hands: Dauphine

Dial: Black

Strap: Original Crisp Genuine Leather

Price: ~~$175~~ $120 shipped CONUS


Discover the dream watch of dried meat devotees, an horological testament to the world’s most beloved gas station meat snack: 

**The Tank de Slim Jim**

The polished steel case measures an elegant 27mm across, sharing the same wrist presence as the esteemed Tank Louis Cartier. The pristine curved crystal gives view to a striking black dial centered on dauphine hands that radiate from the classic Slim Jim logo. Tastefully slim art-deco roman numeral indices adorn the twelve, three, six and nine o’clock positions. 

The still-stickered stainless steel caseback guards a finely tuned Citizen Miyota cal. 2034 Japanese Quartz movement. This elegant timepiece boasts the original crisp and unworn gloss black crocodile-pattern genuine leather strap.

This watch is in very good condition. There are some very light scratches on the case near the crown that can be seen in the light. I have done my best to reflect this in the pictures. I have not been able to discover another example of this unique bite of snack history.

Snap into this Slim Jim tank, r/watchexchange, for ~~$175~~ $120 shipped to the CONUS. Venmo or $app preferred, PayPal accepted, all trades considered.

We are proud to introduce our first ever conversion with a jeweled motor barrel complication produced by E. Howard Watch Co in Waltham, Massachusetts in 1911. It is powered by the Series 5 movement, which is a 19 jewel Howard in-house movement featuring ruby and sapphire jewels with a jeweled motor barrel. This movement was only produced for two years between 1910-1912 with very few in the hunter configuration. At the time of manufacturing, this timepiece was considered top-of-the-line by American watchmakers. The Howard dial features Roman Numerals and is in flawless condition void of chips, cracks, and hairlines.

**Dial**: Howard porcelain-enamel dial with Roman Numerals in flawless condition. The dial is void of chips, cracks, and hairlines. Dial text is crisp and clean.

**Hands**: Blue-steel hands. Hands were restored via thermal coloring.

**Case**: New silver colored case. Diameter is 50 mm, lug width in 24 mm, height is 20 mm, and lug-to-lug is 58 mm.

**Movement**: 19 jewel E Howard featuring a jeweled motor barrel complication. Only manufactured for two years between 1910 – 1912.

* Amplitude = 315 degrees
* Beat Error = 0.2 ms
* Complication = Jeweled motor barrel
* Power Reserve = 24-30 hours
* Frequency = 18,000 (5 beats per second)

**Service History**: The watch was serviced in 2021 and comes with a 1-year service warranty. The watch was inspected and cleaned. The watch was re-assembled and oiled using high-grade Swiss oil. The movement was timed and adjusted to keep time approximately +6 seconds per day dial side up. Time keeping will vary depending on position.

**About us**: We are a small batch, custom watch restoration company located in Central Arkansas USA. Our mission is to preserve and enhance vintage and antique watches. Everything we work on is done in house completely by hand. Each timepiece we produce is one-of-a-kind.

As nature slows down the beginning of winter (Rittō), flurries of snow (Shōsetsu) begin before the heavy snow (Taisetsu). This season welcomes the shortest day of the year (Tōji), as days become cold (Shōkan), and life experiences the coldest day of the year (Taikan).

For sale is my absolutely beautiful Grand Seiko “Winter” edition. This watch is truly stunning and it pains me to have to part with it, but there is another piece I’m currently after. I have 4 verified transactions on WTS and have been on eBay for over a decade with 100% positive feedback.

"[WTS] Rolex Oyster Perpetual 39mm 114300 - No original box/papers, but includes confirmation of authenticity from Rolex Service HQ in Manhattan and Leather Service Pouch ~ $8,000For sale is my Rolex OP 39mm 114300. I purchased this watch from a grey dealer in Manhattan earlier in the year. The watch does not come with the original box or papers. However, I took it to Rolex's service center in Manhattan and received a confirmation of authenticity together with a service pouch. The papers note that the case and bracelet have scratches etc. from normal signs of use. It also appears that the lugs may have been re-finished (they are brushed radially, as opposed to vertically). Finally, one of the links on the bracelet is after-market. I did not have the watch serviced because the movement is running perfectly (about +1 spd)

I am asking $8,000 OBO insured and shipped CONUS. Please let me know if you have any questions.

"[WTS] ORIS x HODINKEE Diver 65Hello! Here's the recently dropped Oris x Hodinkee Diver 65. This is a unique 65 for a few reasons, but mainly due to the newly released in house Oris Cal 400. The watch also features a 38mm case size, forest green dial, and countdown bezel.

Dimensions: 38mm case, 19mm lugs tapering down to around 14mm at the clasp. 44mm lug to lug. This watch wears wonderfully, my wrist is 6.5""for reference in the photos.

Condition: The watch was sized at an Oris AD and has been worn. Some hairlines exist on the clasp. The case/bracelet/crystal/bezel are in good condition with minimal signs of wear - the clasp and bracelet show some hairlines from regular wear.

Accessories: The watch comes with everything it was initially retailed with. Oris includes a nice leather pouch for these instead of a traditional box. 10yr factory warranty as well!

Price: $3300 shipped. Payable via wire/Paypal or Venmo (for users with excellent feedback)Thoughts on the Watch: This piece received a lot of flak when it was released due to the price. Many commenters compared it to the BB58 and there was a general outcry of ""Oris isnt worth this price."" I think most folks forgot this is a LE drop and was not designed to appeal to the mass market - hence the limited 400pc run. This watch has unique charm and excellent build quality.

This watch has also been taken diving in the Florida Keys - performed flawlessly. Fret not about the 100m water resistance.

"[WTS/WTT] Rolex Oyster Perpetual 114200Hey everyone! Today I’m listing my daily for a little bit now, and I’m still wearing it as I type this. The blue dial is what caught my eye when I bought it, and it hasn’t stopped catching my eye since.

Don’t let the size deceive you. I’m 6’3” with a 7-inch wrist and this watch wears beautifully. Rolex always finds a way to make their watches seem larger than advertised, as this 34mm watch wears like any 36mm watch from another brand.

It is currently keeping time at +3spd on my timegrapher.

Overall the watch is in very good condition, with scratches, scuffs, and a few nicks from normal wear. The pictures portray the condition of the watch accurately.

This watch has a scrambled serial number, so it was made sometime after 2011.

The watch comes with 14 links, more than enough to be sized however needed. I am also throwing in a Rolex service pouch.

I am asking **$4,999*** shipped and insured CONUS. I am partial to a cash sale, however if trading, I am only looking to trade down. TV is **$5,199** if something catches my eye.

I take Zelle, Venmo, CashApp, Wise, and PayPal F&amp;F if the user has significant transaction history on here.

"[WTS] TAG HEUER PROFESSIONAL 1000 Gold “Wolf of Wallstreet”TAG HEUER PROFESSIONAL 1000 Gold “Wolf Of Wallstreet”.

This watch recently has had the mineral crystal replaced with sapphire. The sapphire is in perfect condition. The watch is in very good shape and comes with both the 18mm horween leather rally strap &amp; the gold TAG jubilee.

Battery was recently replaced. One thing to note about this watch, Watch contains the original movement, I synced the TAG to my Casio Duro 2+  weeks ago and it has since kept perfect time but, it is an old watch (late 80’s / early 90’s) with an old movement so YRMV! 

All work done on this watch was done by the great and powerful u/jkbenn02 of Tag1000Divers.com

Sapphire crystal front, screwdown crown, 100m or water resistance. Has the caliber t601 (eta 2824 based) running around +16 seconds or so. I’m sure you can have it regulated in a little better. 

Cosmetically the watch is in really good condition. There is a small hairline scratch on the bezel at 12 o’clock, impossible to see in. Most lights, and a couple hairline scratches on the edge of bezel near 1 o’clock. Couples might hairline scratches on the bracket polished center links but nothing major. And the classic scratches on the back of the lugs from strap changes. Overall it’s pretty much new looking in most lights. 

Watch comes with original box, all original links(4 links extra currently sized for 6.5in wrist), and about 4 years 10 months of warranty left. Bought in October from an AD. [Pictures ](https://imgur.com/a/Jn0HI3F) and [Timestamp ](https://imgur.com/a/PCnY1Sf)

"[WTS][USA] Omega Seamaster Ceramic Co-Axial 300M Black; 2500D with Full KitFor sale is the Omega Seamaster 300M Co-Axial ceramic ""no wave"" in black.

It has the most reliable version of the 2500 Co-Axial movement, the 2500D. The 2500D was upgraded from the previous 2500C to have a tri-level Co-Axial escapement, instead of the previous bi-level. Omega has continued to use tri-level escapements in the 8500, 8900 and other current movements because of the improved reliability.

Full size, 41mm.

The movement is running within COSC spec and shows strong amplitude; see photo. It won’t be due for service for several more years. The watch case was cleaned, o-rings regreased, and passed water resistance testing to 50m (the limits of my equipment). The bezel action is nicely tight (see video).

The pictures tell the story, so I will defer to them to see the exact condition. The photos are high resolution and can be opened in a new window at full size that can hide no flaw.

Includes a full set (box, papers, hang tag, original caseback sticker, and two additional full links) as shown.

"[WTS] Omega Speedmaster Reduced 39mm *Mint* 175.0032Available immediately, this OMEGA Speedmaster Reduced “Speedy Reduced” 39mm is in absolutely outstanding condition for being 20+ years old. Iconic is an understatement for anything Speedmaster related in the world of horology, and this is one fine example of such. Serial dates this to 1998.

Small seconds at 3 o’clock, 30min counter 9 o’clock, 12hr counter 6 o’clock, luminescent hands and indices

Crisp sharp edges on the case, nearly perfect bezel and clasp, this Speedy is in phenomenal condition. The stainless bracelet has below average stretch for a watch of this age, and will fit roughly 7” wrist (additional links available for small fee). Although this watch comes on a bracelet, the 39mm Speedy is known for being a “strap monster” and insanely customizable and comfortable on all NATO straps. The movement winds butter smooth, chronograph functions as it should, and watch is keeping good time.

Summary

Here’s a beautiful King Quartz. February 1978 is a beautiful JDM piece. The textured snowflake dial is in great shape without any major corrosion or burning. There is some mild corrosion on the periphery and if you look closely a spot of discoloration at the 8 o’ clock hour. It’s perfectly sized at 38mm and it’s case is in great shape with few scratches, same thing with the caseback. Battery hatch has annoying stripping to it, signed crown is original, quickdate function and time set functions are working well. The original textured bracelet is full and in great shape. Just installed a brand new battery and running strong !!

"[WTS] Tudor Black Bay 58 Gilt on Bracelet M79030NUp for sale is my Black Bay Fifty-Eight on bracelet. This is the gilt version reference number M79030N-001. Everything pictured here is included in the sale: https://i.imgur.com/YhqhdKc.jpg

This watch was originally purchased in September  2021 so there is plenty of Tudor warranty left. I purchased the watch from eBay so all the additional authentication paperwork/card from eBay is also included. 

The watch is in great condition but it has been worn. There are a few very faint marks and I tried my best to show them in the photos. The most obvious ones are probably on the high polish portions of the case / bracelet, very light marks on the clasp, and very light marks on the caseback / lugs.

"[WTS] Tudor Prince Oysterdate 9050/0 w/custom Rolex California re-dial**For Sale:** Tudor Prince Oysterdate ref. 9050/0 with the Automatic ETA 2784 movement. 45 hour power reserve with a. 28800 beat 25 jewel, the movement is a powerhouse.

**Watch Shots:** [https://imgur.com/a/MpdYyGF](https://imgur.com/a/MpdYyGF) this album contains HD images and some great videos

**Timestamp:** [https://imgur.com/a/Ss40TvT](https://imgur.com/a/Ss40TvT)

**Scope:** Watch only

**Watch Details:** 35mm (slightly larger due to the aftermarket diamond and emerald bezel) which excludes crown, \~37mm including. This measures 42mm lug to lug with a 19mm lug width and 11mm thick.

This is on an aftermarket Aaron Bespoke light gray ostrich leather strap with matching green accents and a Rolex stamped vintage buckle, the strap will accommodate a wrist size approximately up to 7-3/4"" with additional holes.

The Rolex 9050/0 Prince Oysterdate is the more-affordable Tudor answer to the Rolex Datejust. Tudor Oyster timepieces started to appear in 1946 as manual-wind watches. Most were housed in 34mm steel Oyster cases and featured a vast array of dial variations. In 1952, the “Oyster Prince” was introduced. Prince signified the presence of an automatic movement and was Tudor's equivalent of Rolex's “Perpetual”.

The 9050/0 is a lovely flashy and yet subtle dress watch is ideal for a night out or suitable for a casual occasion or formal dress event. This watch features a custom redial featuring a California style with dual logo. Also featured and hard to ignore is the diamond and emerald encrusted bezel sitting atop the watch. The natural green emeralds featured pair well with the green in the dial. A roulette date wheel gives a bit of red splash to the otherwise clear sparkle of the diamonds and green of the emerald dial and markers in the bezel and cream featured on the hour markers.

As for condition, this is subjective. I feel I could leave something out unintentionally and everyone's level of acceptance for condition is different. What I feel is minor may be major to you. I have taken the most detailed photos and videos and I am available to answer any questions or take closer macros of areas of concern but I invite you to review the watch shots imgur album.  This watch seems to be polarizing so you either love it or hate it.  This watch has had a recent service including new OEM crystal, clean, polish, service, and professional affixing of the bezel. It also comes with the original bezel.

**Pricing:** I am asking **$2300 USD** shipped/insured OTD net funds to me, slightly negotiable. Please no trades. I prefer Paypal F&amp;F unless you have significant feedback on here, I can also accept xfers on Wise (previously Transferwise). Bank wire would also be fine with me.

I have other watches for sale right now, a Tudor Jumbo Date Day 7019/4, a Tudor 7966, a Tudor Sport Chrono 20300, an Omega Seamaster, an Omega Speedmaster and others to come. Please check my other post(s) and my Instagram for more.

"[WTS] Monta Ocean King Steel Bezel $950OLD OLD OLD 

Up for sale is my Monta Ocean King. Everything pictured here is included: https://i.imgur.com/HnqDfTb.jpg

Condition is well used with signs of wear and tear on the case, bezel, bezel insert, bracelet and clasp. Pretty much everywhere except the crystal has marks. The crystal is perfect and free of any defects I can see or feel. 

This is a catch and release for me - I’ve worn it for about a week but the watch is just visually too large for me with the steel bezel insert. The previous owner had the watch serviced by Monta in August 2021 and the watch worked perfectly for me.  The clasp has many scratches and marks but the micro adjust on the fly was amazing and worked just about as good as a Rolex Glidelock but the Monta clasp has less micro adjust positions. 

I encourage you to check out the video to see how the signs of wear and tear changes as the lighting changes. I also took quite a few photos that had to split into two albums.

"[WTS] Omega Speedmaster Professional Mark II - 145.014 RacingHere we have a vintage Omega Speedmaster Mark II (ref. 145.014) - Racing Dial. This reference was only produced from 1969 to 1973 and features the legendary Omega 861 movement. This example has the desirable racing-dial featuring orange accents and an orange chronograph hand. 

This watch was last serviced about 8 years ago and keeps time well. I ran this side by side with another Mark II that was restored by Omega last year and saw no difference in timing. As best I can tell, this has never been polished and still retains a little bit of the original sunburst finish and Speedmaster case-back. 

However, this is a 50 year old watch so it’s not going to be perfect. There’s a tiny chip in the glass between the 2 and 3 o'clock positions (unnoticeable from more than a foot away), and a couple dings at the bottom of the case, along with plenty of light scratches that come with 50 years of wear. The original bracelet is in similar condition but the clasp still holds tight. Included is a black, grey, and orange NATO strap…which is nothing special but really makes the dial colors pop.

"[WTS] Zenith El Primero Chronomaster, 39.5MM white lacquered dial. Mint.Hi everyone,

I'm listing this beautiful and rare piece that I unfortunately don't get to wear enough. This Zenith El Primero Chronomaster comes in the perfect size of 39.5mm with booklets and original COSC certification papers and is in really mint condition for a watch of its age (1994). The watch runs well at +4 seconds a day and the case is in pristine condition with no bumps or dings and only very faint hairline scratches.

The watch sports the famous 10 BPS El Primero movement in a display back case. The dial is luscious and classy off-white lacquered that you won't typically see in more modern El Primero iterations. I'm sad to let this one go, but hopefully it will find a good home with someone who wears it a little more than I do.

"[WTS] Tudor Blackbay 58All,

Posting up by BB58 Blue for sale! I’ve had the watch for almost a year now and have enjoyed owning and wearing a bit, but just doesn’t get enough wrist time in my collection to justify holding onto it.

Watched was purchased (and warranty card is dated) in December 2020 from an AD. Watch comes with both inner and outer box, as well as the white sleeve, all links (3 currently removed on the bracelet, which will be included in the box), all papers / books, hang tag, and warranty card.

Watch is in great condition, has some regular wear and tear scratches, but nothing major. I work a desk job so hasn’t really been put through much. 

I am asking $3,600 net for the watch. I’ve bought / old a few things on here, feedback available on WatchExchangeFeedback. Happy to send additional pictures or hop on a quick FaceTime call to share additional details or bring comfort around the watch.

Willing to ship insured anywhere in the CONUS or do a local pickup in the Chicago area.

"[WTS] Seiko SPB153 WillardHey Everyone,   
  
This Captain Willard needs a new home. As seen in the photos, the dynamic green dial effortlessly shifts from a sunburst emerald to an olive drab depending on the lighting conditions. It’s in solid condition, with a clean crystal and an aligned bezel, which is not always the case with these modern Willards. There is a small nick on the upper right lug, which is barely visible while on the wrist. Furthermore, Seiko’s use of deft undercuts and smaller dials allow this Willard to wear more comfortably than the published dimensions would suggest.  
  
Package includes inner and outer Seiko boxes, warranty card dated November 2020 and two complimentary straps: an aftermarket waffle and a matching green ballistic nylon from Halios.  
  
Since the Seiko strap was old separately, price has been reduced to $740 (Zelle preferred), which includes insured shipping within CONUS.

"[WTS] Vintage Omega Seamaster 2576 With 342 Bumper Movement WORKSFor sale is a Vintage Omega Seamaster reference 2576 with 342 Bumper Movement.

The watch needs a good cleaning and service, but still runs. The crown, hand setting, and winding all work. The watch runs about 40 seconds slow per day when compared to my atomic clock, but I do not have a timegrapher to accurately time it. From what I’ve seen, 40 seconds slow per day is pretty good for a watch of this age!

The watch is being old AS IS. It runs, but I chose not to have it serviced to keep it as close to original as possible and let the buyer decide the extent of restoration he/she would like to pursue.

Asking Price: $1200

Price is in USD and includes standard shipping to the United States. PayPal F&amp;F only unless you have EXTENSIVE references, which we can discuss.

"[WTS] Tag Heuer Carrera Calibre 01 CAR208Z.FT6046Timestamp: https://imgur.com/a/bUW6ySk


Just trying to thin out the collection as I have too many watches that don’t get any wrist time.

Picked up this 43mm Tag Heuer Carrera Calibre Heuer 01 ref. CAR208Z.FT6046 in late August and wore it exactly twice outside the house since. Bought it from Bernard Watch Co for $3320 before tax (retailed $5600).

Very good condition with no noticeable scratches on the case. A couple of minor scuffs on the clasp but nothing deep. Some scuffs on the inside of the clasp as well where there is metal-on-metal contact.

Band came sized &amp; cut – currently sized to my ~7.5” wrist, but there is an additional ~1.5” so probably enough strap for around 8.7”. Other than being cut, strap is in perfect condition and you can still smell the factory scent.

Lume is surprisingly good given the size of the markers &amp; hands. Surface area is small, but brightness and longevity is good vs some heavy hitting divers. 30min comparison below.

Movement is the Heuer 01. Accuracy is within COSC spec in 5 positions I tested and +5 to +7 in the 6th (12 o’clock down – pics below). I don’t think this is COSC certified but it is performing well.

Comes with original box but no guarantee/warranty card. I will include my purchase receipt as well.


Specs:

Case diameter: 43 mm

Lug-to-lug: 53 mm Thickness:

"[WTS] Speake-Marin Spirit MkIIHere's another that hurts to let go...

For sale is my Speake-Marin Spirit MkII. A rare bird you don't see every day. This watch has some serious character that comes out in different lightings. Direct sunlight brings out the black dial's grainy nature. Overcast lighting showcases the 3d aspect of the watches markers/writing. No lighting lets the lume shine! Nearly everything about this watch is unique: case shape, dial, markers, movement. The movement (Technotime TT738) has twin barrels with a 120hour power reserve. Something I've noticed that I haven't seen written/documented anywhere is that the watch stops at almost exactly 12 when it runs low on power. I've noticed this happen around 10 times (and not on any of my other watches) so I'm assuming it's not an accident.

The watch had a $650 service about a year ago (according to the previous owner). The movement is a little complex and unique so it required a decent bit of work to service. However it's been running amazingly for the past two months I've owned it.

**Photos:** https://imgur.com/a/mkxXFPx

**Included:** Speake-Marin Spirit Mk II Watch, original strap, custom strap, leather case, outer box.

**Dimensions:** 42mm diameter, 12mm thick, 20mm lug width.

**Condition:** 8/10. The watch has definitely seen some wear over the years but has also clearly been taken care of. Usual scratches on case sides and case back as well as small marks on the lugs. The front of the watch (bezel/crystal/dial) is nearly flawless. Serviced recently as noted above.

**Year:** 2013

**Timekeeping:** Keeps time to around +5s/day.

"[WTS] Monta Oceanking V2 Gilt No-Date**ALBUM:** [**https://imgur.com/a/ZLuyWV3**](https://imgur.com/a/ZLuyWV3)

**TIMESTAMP:** [**https://imgur.com/OqDr3AJ**](https://imgur.com/OqDr3AJ)

This is an awesome watch. It’s a great size (just a hair over 40mm), thin and lays flat to the wrist, plus - it has one of the most comfortable bracelets currently in production with a glidelock-style quick adjustment! Lots to love here. This model is currently old out on Monta’s website and you don’t see them pop up too often.

This particular example is in excellent condition with light wear from use. There are typical hairline scratches on the polished surfaces. The lugs do show a few marks from strap changes. One thing to note is there is a tiny fleck of dust under the dial around the 34 mark. Everything lines up perfectly, bezel action is good, and there are no scratches whatsoever on the crystal or ceramic bezel. Watch keeps great time as well - about +5 spd. Bracelet does have some marks on the clasp.

Ships with full kit - gigantic Monta box, all paperwork (warranty has since expired), watch pouch, extra links (including one half-link), a Crown &amp; Buckle Chevron “Fifty” strap, and a Crown &amp; Buckle “Vintage Bond” Supreme single pass NATO - both straps look killer on the watch!

PRE-OWNED WATCH CONDITION EXAMINATION:
This Rolex watch is in overall excellent condition. Due to being pre-owned there is minor wear to the clasp, case and bezel.

Rolex Oysterquartz Datejust 17014:
The Rolex Oysterquartz is a very special collection in the Rolex family. Despite the fact that the look of the OysterQuartz is very unusual and outstanding when comparing to other Rolex models, this watch uses a quartz 5035 movement that powers the watch with a quoted accuracy of no more than a 1 minute variation per year!
The watch was first introduced in 1976 and the movement took Rolex 5 years to develop. The Oysterquartz was revolutionary, the precision was better than before, and the movement was the future they believed.
The Oysterquartz was only available in the Datejust version or as a Day-Date in both white and yellow gold. This particular 17014 model is steel with a white gold fluted bezel. The production lasted for 25 years, and during this time only 25,000 examples are speculated to have been made, which actually makes the Oysterquartz a rare watch that you don’t come over every day. Back in 1970 and 1980 quartz watches were the new thing and almost every brand started to make quartz watches. Even the greats such as Audemars Piguet had a 97% production of quartz watches.
Rolex stopped the production of the Oysterquartz in 2001, and it was only seen in the Rolex catalog until 2003 when the stock depleted.
Owning one is truly owning a piece of Rolex history.

"[WTS] Steinhart Ocean One Vintage GMT 42mmIn great overall condition, some minor swirls on the case, and a couple of marks on the bezel between 4 and 6.

The Steinhart rubber strap has been cut/sized to fit a \~6.5"" wrist. I think you can move the pins on the clasp and just use one on the outsides and it would fit an inch or so bigger, but I'm not sure how good of an idea that is, and if it's even designed to do that. Regardless, I'm including an Archer NATO.

"[WTS] Monta Noble Anthracite DialHi Everyone,  
  
Up for sale is my Monta Noble with Anthracite dial.  If you’re not familiar with Monta, they are the same guys behind Everest Straps, and provide a ton of value for the sports-watch buck.  

**Photo Gallery****:**

https://imgur.com/a/s5FD5Cs

&amp;#x200B;

**Timestamp:** 

https://imgur.com/a/vq5SJhn

  
  
The dial has a beautiful, dark, smoky sunray finish with a degrede effect, where it fades a bit darker towards the outside of the dial. This is only the second Monta watch to feature a degrede dial.  Indexes are high polish and applied with superluminova.  The hands are diamond cut, and really well finished.  One of my favorite parts of the hands is how the superluminova is carried to the counterweight of the hand -such a clean look and you see the cross of the hands both in daylight and at night.  Pretty neat.  Crystal is flat and coated with 7 (seven!) layers of anti reflective coating on the underside.  
  
The bracelet is comfortable and shockingly well designed at this price point.  All the links articulate so it really drapes over your wrist.  It features a quick adjust clasp with three slots for micro adjustment.  In addition, the bracelet includes two half links so you are sure to find a perfect fit.  I mostly wore this on straps so the bracelet is barley worn.  
  
There are a lot of nice finishes on the 38.5mm case, with polished bevels, brushed sides, and a high polish bezel.  Lug to lug measurement comes in a very wearable for all wrist sizes 47mm.   the watch clocks in at a mere 9.7mm thick with a 20mm lug with – in the anthracite dial, this watch is a strap monster.  And with a 150M water resistance rating, it’s more capable in the pool than many sports watches from other high end brands.  
  
The movement is a Monta-decorated and adjusted Sellita SW300; a Swiss automatic movement with hacking and hand-winding, a date function (well-executed at six), and a rate of 4 Hz.  
  
The watch comes with the full kit: outer&amp; inner box, warranty card, welcome note, unused polishing cloth, all links.  The watch is in excellent condition, some hairline scuffs on the bezel if you’re really looking for them, and a few minor marks on the underside of the lugs from a strap change or two.  I’m the original owner of this watch and wore it sparingly in rotation with the rest of my collection.  I’m not a dealer, just a guy who likes watches but needs to make room for an incoming.  
  
**I’m asking $1,275** shipped via Fedex, CONUS only, with payment via wire or zelle.  I’ve bought and old on reddit, WUS and in-person (NYC area) and can provide references if needed.  I’m happy to facetime or talk over the phone to answer any questions I can.  Feel free to PM me here or DM me on Instagram at nycwatchdude." 0
"[WTS] Doxa Sub 300T CaribbeanSelling my Doxa 300t Caribbean. Comes with box, stamped warranty card (less than 2 years old), extra links, manual and tag.

I'd say this watch is 93% condition with some minor marks on the polished side case. Some wear on the rear case also. Bracelet clasp shows minimal wear. The crystal is clean. Setting the date/time are as you'd expect. No issues with adjusting the bezel. Ratcheting divers extension is slightly stiff.

Asking $1450 (I'll cover shipping, you cover paypal fees if you are an established member). Not really looking to trade unless you have a Seiko MM300 and I'll add cash
